# Hello World...?

This repo contains a classic "Hello World!" program written in [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), because printing a simple greeting shouldn't be easy, it should be **painfully educational**.

You can test it online here: [https://copy.sh/brainfuck/](https://copy.sh/brainfuck/)

Paste the code, hit run, and be amazed as it prints out.

Why?

Because **just because**.

Also because learning weird languages is fun, and if you can write in Brainfuck, you can probably write in anything. I suppose
